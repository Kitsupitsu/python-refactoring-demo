# Reporting tool
This is my awesome reporting tool! I wrote it myself, but now I don't understand what I have written.

## TODO-list:
- [ ] Rename cryptic variables
- [ ] Replace magic strings with constants
- [ ] Split code into smaller functions
    - [ ] Input parsing
    - [ ] Calculations
    - [ ] Output formatting
- [ ] Remove duplication
- [ ] Remove excessive branching and nested if-elses
- [ ] Stop mutating totals in many places
- [ ] Improve error handling
    - [ ] Use a structured error record
    - [ ] What happens if amount or date is bad?
- [ ] Add comments so my friend can understand this code too

## Why have I written so bad code?
This code was made for PyLadies Tampere meetup at Futurice office in February 19th 2026. [Here are the slides I presented in the meetup](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K0_P5VDRZz7omTv32fvAYPTXI0WjoTWQG9DvZ5_BUT0/edit?usp=sharing).
